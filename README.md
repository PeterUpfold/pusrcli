# PU Status Reporter CLI

This is an internal tool I use to communicate with my StatusReporter web service, which essentially provides
a very simple key-value store for information relating to my bespoke IoT/home automation "stuff" and helps me
keep tabs on various headless systems I have running at home.

This project supports communicating with the web service from Python 3 and presents a simple command line query interface.
